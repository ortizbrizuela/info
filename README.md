# Welcome!

## üìö Background

I am a medical doctor, having graduated from the [Facultad de Medicina UASLP](https://www.medicina.uaslp.mx/). I specialized in Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, both at the [Instituto Nacional de Ciencias M√©dicas y Nutrici√≥n Salvador Zubir√°n](http://www.incmnsz.mx/) in Mexico City. My passion for research led me to pursue a Master of Science in Epidemiology from the [Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/), and a Master of Science in Clinical Sciences from [UNAM](http://www.facmed.unam.mx), Mexico. I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Epidemiology at McGill. You can have a look at a more complete resume [here](https://github.com/ortizbrizuela/info/blob/main/docs/CV_EOB_2024.pdf).
