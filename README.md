# Welcome to My Personal Website!

My name is **Edgar Ortiz-Brizuela**, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Epidemiology at McGill University. Here, you'll find a brief overview of my background üìö, links to my work ‚úèÔ∏è, and ways to connect with me ‚úâÔ∏è. I am always open to collaboration!

## üìö Background

I am a medical doctor, having graduated from the Facultad de Medicina UASLP (University of San Luis Potosi Faculty of Medicine) in Mexico [website: [medicina.uaslp.mx](https://www.medicina.uaslp.mx/#gsc.tab=0)]. I specialized in Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, both at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias M√©dicas y Nutrici√≥n Salvador Zubir√°n in Mexico City [website: [www.incmnsz.mx](http://www.incmnsz.mx/)]. My passion for research led me to pursue a Master of Science in Epidemiology from the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health at McGill University [website: [www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/)], and a Master of Science in Clinical Sciences from UNAM, Mexico [website: [www.medicina.unam.mx](http://www.facmed.unam.mx)]. I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Epidemiology at McGill.
